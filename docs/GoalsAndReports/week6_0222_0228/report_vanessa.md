# Goal 1: Finalize Tableau Dashboards

I was successful in cleaning up the two dashboards, including changing colors and unlinking the two dashboards (`02_eda/EDA_2013_2020.twb`). Instead of uploading them to Duke's Public Tableau site, I uploaded them to my own site: https://public.tableau.com/profile/vanessa.tang#!/vizhome/MajorCoursePlanning/MajorCourse. Eventually, we will use this link to send to students to test this prototype. This works towards the goal of **tracking academic pathway** by facilitating major and course selection in addition to course planning. I think that this was a modest goal and was comfortably completed in the time frame. It also works well in the timeline of our project, as we expect to send out the dashboard link to undergraduate students in about 1-2 weeks.

# Goal 2: Wireframe for Website

I did not end up completing this goal as Becky did the wireframe instead using a different platform. As a team, we did provide feedback and fine-tuning after presenting to our stakeholders. I think it was helpful in really showing what we expect a final product to look like with the target audience of undergraduate students.

# Goal 3: Alluvial Plots

## Sub-Goal 3.1: Interactive Alluvial Plots

I was successful in figuring out how to use Plotly to create interactive alluvial plots (`03_intermediate/alluvial/plotly_plots`). The current plots in the `plotly_plots` directory track students over all 8 semesters, but it is also easy to change the number of semesters to track (ex: semester 1 to 2, 3 to 4, etc.). This contributes to the overall project goal of **tracking academic pathway** as it helps show how students flow through different classes. I think this was a modest goal as well, as it required some research as well as implementation in terms of coding. In terms of pacing, I think completing interactive alluvial plots in the time frame was good because it allows us to also think about how this could be used for students in conjunction with the dashboards and the wireframe. 

## Sub-Goal 3.2: Streamline on DSS

I ended up encountering package and environment issues with DSS because of package dependences and because the students do not have complete access to change DSS settings. There are workarounds to this, and I am working with Darien to fix these issues. However, the purpose of putting the alluvial plots on DSS was to enable filtering by major, but with the new Plotly alluvial plots, I am now able to easily filter by major. Therefore, we do not need DSS for alluvial plots, as the Plotly implementation (`03_intermediate/alluvial/plotly_plots`) accomplishes both goals of interactivity (Sub-goal 3.1) as well as filtering by major (Sub-goal 3.2). Again, these alluvial plots contribute to the overall goal of **tracking academic pathway** and can help show the flow of students for different majors. I think this was a modest goal, and I was happy that the new Plotly implementation accomplishes both goals easily. 

# Summary

In summary, I was successful in cleaning up the Tableau dashboards as well as creating interactive alluvial plots that enable showing different numbers of semesters as well as different majors. I am happy with the progress we've made as a team, as we are working on sending out a prototype dashboard website soon.
