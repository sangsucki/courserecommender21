This week following the goals I set, I have achieved the following:

(i) Wireframe the application if put into production. This wireframe incorperated the Tableau dashboard and at the same time provide recommendations obtained from model results separately, so that users can look at the recommended items from the recommendation model but only pick those they decide to take in the dashboard to see trajectory. I have created a simple wireframe prototype by drawing on the design app Figma. I have also drafted a google form to incorperate some questions that might need to be asked to the undergraduate students for feedbacks.

(ii) With regard to modeling, I wrapped up the matrix factorization models including SVD and LightFM which have consistently low performance inrespective of different kinds of processing. I tried the same pre-processing (excluding least popular class taken fewer by N=100 students to limit search space) and report the results with recommended items equaling 15. Here the value N was not changed according each term and each major since there appears consistent low prediction accuracy (~10%) across semester and major. Overall, the neighborhood method is the one model we will be going forward with.

At last, I started writing on the final report bit by bit. So far we have many contents including all the attempts for different methods. The modelling part is very sufficiently explained but still needs further structuring.

[Ilona: good job! Consider having an extended plan of the final paper to have an overview of what will be there. I am happy to discuss the plan once you are ready]
