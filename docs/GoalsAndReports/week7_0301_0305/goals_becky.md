This week after consulting with Frank and discussing with the team, I plan to achieve the following:

(i) We plan to send out survey with regard to the tableau dashboard. The dashboard has successfully been made into a website format for public to review. There are specific instructions on top of it. At the next meeting with Frank, we will confirm on the contents of the survey to be sent out to the undergradate students for their feedbacks. With regard to the audience, we plan to reach out to the Duke Machine Learning group who have previously made similar course recommendation in the realm of machine learning. We hope to be get their help to send out surveys to a small group of selected undergraduate students who might have some level of machine learning experience to understand or be interested in what we are doing. 

[Ilona: make sure that you have checked previous literature describing the studies that distributed similar surveys. It will help you to think about what domains of questions to include in the survey]

(ii) I plan to wrok on the course description data that Frank will further provide. The idea behind is that so far there are too many course taking trajectories even within the same major when we consider each course as an individual item. However, if we can somehow group the courses together based on their attributes, the course taking trajectories might become clearer to see with clusters of courses. Another objective is to try to find whether we can gather skill information from the course descriptions. This is part of the project that the Duke Machine Learning group has previously shared with us. By doing topic modelling on the course text data, it might be possible to interpret some skills essential to certain majors, which will provide valuable information to the students too.

(iii) I will continue working on the final report. I plan to add more contents and be more specific on the final deliverable part, i.e. the tableau dashboard and the website survey we plan to send out. 


(iv) With regard to modeling, we decided to go with neighborhood method that has achieved the highest prediction accuracy. I plan to furhter explore on the neural network part of the recommendation system. This item is of low priority and the previous three goals will be firstly attempted.
[Ilona: sounds good]
