# Goal 1: Prepare Tableau Dashboards to Send Out to Undergrad Students

We are planning on sending out the Tableau Dashboards (https://public.tableau.com/profile/vanessa.tang#!/vizhome/MajorCoursePlanning/MajorCourse) to undergraduate students in the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group in 1-2 weeks. In order to prepare these dashboards to send out, based on feedback from Frank, I want to make the following changes:

- Split Major and Course Selection page into two separate dashboards: one for major selection given input classes and another for course selection for selected major and term. We think that this will make it easier for students to use and understand.
- Clarify instructions: I want to reword some of the instructions especially as it relates to inputting classes and selecting majors. For major selection, I want to emphasize that students should be putting in classes they have already taken. For course planning, they should be inputting classes they want to take in the future.

This contributes to the project goal of facilitating course and major selection for students, as these dashboards help with course and major selection and well as course planning. I will complete these tasks individually. I aim to have this done by the next meeting next Tuesday so that we can get final approval from Frank before sending it out to students.

[Ilona: if you sending materials to undergrads (or a different group DAML), you need to create a very clear guideline explaining how your model works and what it does and does not do.]

# Goal 2: Create Feedback Form for Dashboards

When sending out the dashboard link to undergrads, we also want feedback in terms of how easy it is to use/understand, if it's helpful, if they'd recommend it to other students, what else would be helpful, etc. In order to gather this feedback, we could use a simple Google form and attach the link to the dashboards as well as send it out in the email to students. However, I fear that there will be a low response rate, especially because it is a separate forum. Tableau does enable polling (https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/blog/2014/04/how-turn-viz-poll), so I will try to implement that and add it as a page to the current Tableau dashboards. This would be really helpful because it would allow users to provide feedback without having to go to an external site. 

[Ilona: consider adding questions related to how well they understand what the model does, why and why not they will want to use the model in their decisions].

This works in conjunction with the Tableau dashboards, because we want to know what the users (undergraduate students) actually think about the usefulness and usability of the dashboards. I will also complete this goal individually and aim to have it done within a week and a half so that it is ready to send out to student within two weeks.
