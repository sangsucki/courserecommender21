This week I have achieved and planned the following:

(i) We confirmed the survey to send out with regard to the tableau dashboard. We received one single feedback from the survey sent using the previous method. Through discussing with the project manager, and couple of iterations of internal discussions, we have updated some of the questions and the format of how to conduct the survey. Within the survey, it is decided to include information such as which year and what major the student is current undertaking. In addition to the academic background, there are questions which are in rating format to judge the usefulness of every section. There are also text boxes for filling in the feedbacks or any free thoughts in general. With valuable insights from Frank, we will proceed with emailing the survey with randomly selected students and also at the samee time scheduling panel-interviews with both the undergraduate student party as well as the some selected advisor to get both sides' perspectives. 

(ii) The course description data that Frank further provides has much text data to conduct more NLP analysis. With this data, I will investigate whether we can do topic modelling LDA to cluster groups of classes. It might be easier to find out certain clusters of courses have certain characteristics such as skill sets needed for a certain major overlapping with one another. Such results would be really useful for the students to be integrated with the existing alluvial plots of course trajectories. By doing topic modelling on the long course description data, it might be possible to interpret some skills essential to certain majors, which will provide valuable information to the students too. 

(iii) I have drafted an outline for the final report together with the team. Although very high level at this point, I am gradually building a skeleton and filling in the contents as we proceed. So far we have good background introduction and data description. Based on final paper from last semester, we will only include essential information and be more focusing on deliverables in terms of content.

(iv) The timeline for the remaining of the semester on the project has been scheduleed as the following for reference:
4/1 : Advisor meeting
4/4 : Final report
4/6: Undergraduate student meeting
4/9: Capstone presentation
4/13: Stakeholder final meeting
