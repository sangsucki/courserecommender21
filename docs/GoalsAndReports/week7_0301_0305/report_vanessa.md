# Goal 1: Prepare Tableau Dashboards to Send Out to Undergrad Students

My first goal was to prepare the dashboards to send out to students (https://public.tableau.com/profile/vanessa.tang#!/vizhome/MajorCoursePlanning/MajorCourse). I was successful in making the following changes:
- Split the Major and Course Selection page into two separate pages: I created two separate pages: one for Major Selection and one for Course Selection. These are now reflected on the public Tableau dashboard.
- I also reworded some of the instructions on the Home page to make them more concise and also changed phrasing on each of the pages to clarify course entry. For the Major and Course Selection pages, it is emphasized that students should enter in the classes they have already taken. On the Course Planning page, it is emphasized that students should enter in classes they are planning on taking.
- As per advice from Ilona, I added a note about the data dates (2013-2020) and the number of graduates per major during that time period. This helps give more context to the numbers on the dashboard.

Overall, this contributes to the project goal of facilitating course and major selection for students, as these dashboards help with course and major selection and well as course planning. These changes can be seen in `02_eda/EDA_2013_2020.twb` and the public Tableau dashboard link above. Pacing for this goal was reasonable, as it was completed early enough to have time to work on the survey before sending out the dashboard link.

# Goal 2: Create Feedback Form for Dashboards

My second goal was to create a feedback form for the dashboards. Instead of integrating it through Tableau as previously mentioned, we created a Google Form because it allows text feedback, whereas the Tableau integration was just for numerical feedback. We need this text feedback because it is more valuable in seeing where and why students had issues or struggled with the dashboards. It provides more detailed, actionable feedback for us to use to make changes to the dashboards. This survey is now linked at the bottom of the Home Page as well as through the Feedback button. It can also be seen in `02_eda/EDA_2013_2020.twb`.

This works in conjunction with the Tableau dashboards, because we want to know what the users (undergraduate students) actually think about the usefulness and usability of the dashboards. This can help us make changes to future iterations of the dashboards. Pacing for this goal was also reasonable, and we were able to send out the dashboards a few days ago. 

# Summary

Over the last two weeks, we were able to prepare all materials necessary to send out the dashboards to students. We are still awaiting feedback and hope to get more feedback over the next 1-2 weeks from both students and advisors.
