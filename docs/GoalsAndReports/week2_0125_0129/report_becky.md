I was able to complete the following goals:
for (i), we have established the final delivery objectives with the client and determined a rough timeline within the team. The final objectives include 1. improve model prediction accuracy, and 2. explore student course behavior patterns (which can potentially be fed back into model). [Ilona: when you are setting a goal with the word "explore" be mindful about milestones, you need to have tangible deliverables in mind. How do you know that you have achieved your goal?]

for (ii), I revisited the lightfm model and re-tested on the small datasets (`econ_05_09.csv` and `top5_05_09.csv`). The self-defined accuracy results showed fluctuations and are not consistent with the records uploaded in the last semester. I am still in the process of investigating what errors might have appeared in the code that caused this discrepency. [Ilona: these steps need to be included in the next goals, are you still planning to process the errors? It is good to plan when you hope/expect to stop working on this goal, what is the maximum you are hoping to achieve?]

That being said, neither the before and after results perform well with both consistently below 20% prediction coverage. This might suggest that the lightfm model may not work very well with this problem. Therefore I am also investigating into the neighborhood model built by Sangsoek. [Ilona: the same comment as above]

for (iii), as discussed with the team, as it would be a more manual process to come up with business rules (academic constraints) with respect to each curriculum requirements. After discussing with the team, it seems not a feasible idea as there is too much granularity for each major.

This week I have also read more on a textbook called Recommender Systems by Charu C. Aggarwal. I learned there are several business concepts that can be implemented for evaluation purpose, including relevance, novelty, serendipity, and diversity. So far what we implemented is a self-defined top-k prediction accuracy which only touches on relevance of courses based on history records. It could be possible that we also self-define metrics for novelty or diversity which covers the latent interest of students aside from curriculum-related courses. [Awesome! this is a great summary of learning goals. You described knew knowledge that you acquired and also discussed how you plan to apply it in the future. Perfect!]

Apart from previously-set goal, we had a meeting on Friday this week with a faculty memeber, Professor John Haws, who has worked with registration data. He provided valuable insights which we will attempt in the following week.

Overall, the estimated time was too ambitious and did not align well with the goal. The plan and to-dos will be adjusted accordingly and will be listed in more details for next week's goal. [Ilona: great that you have realized that your time estimates were too ambitious and you plan to correct it]
