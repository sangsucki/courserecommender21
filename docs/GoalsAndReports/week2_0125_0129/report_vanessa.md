With respect to goal (i) of aligning semester goals between the team and stakeholders, I was able to clearly outline how the team is planning on proceeding with the remainder of the semester (refining models, trying on new subsets, apply to DSS). [Ilona: great that you are thinking not only about your goal but considering team perspective]

Goal (ii) discusses the stakeholder expectations rather than the _team's_ plan for the semester. This is more so of what Frank sees the project at the end of the semster rather than how we want to proceed with the project. After asking Frank what he wants at the end of the semester, he said improving model accuracy was his primary goal, but we could also consider conducting a survey to determine if a recommender system would be helpful for undergrads. [Ilona: While generally, the survey is a great idea, I recommend focusing on the modeling, you will not be able to accomplish the survey in the time you have. However, you might just have a couple (~5) informal conversations with people (undergrads) you know. Run by them what are you doing, they might give you some novel perspective]

For goal (iii), refining SVD model, changing model parameters had minimal effect on performance. Considering the neighborhood method performs better, it may not be worthwhile to continue pursuing SVD for performance but rather for latent features. [Ilona: any deliverables? how do you know that it is not worth pursuing anymore? Reports need to be very specific]
