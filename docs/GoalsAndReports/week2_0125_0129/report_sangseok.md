Regarding (i), we set our final goal at the end of this semester with the client. Our fianl goal will be to improve model prediction accuracy and figure out the academic class patterns that students take based on different majors. 
Regarding (ii), first, we had a meething with John Haws, who is one of MIDS faculty and also worked with Duke Registrar. He was interested in our models and I explained the logic behind one of our successful models. He suggested possible directions for the next step. Second, I visited an office hour with Craig Rawlings, who is a professor teaching 'Network Analysis'. [Ilona: great job!] I briefly summarized our project and he suggested several papers that might help us to approach a new method to look at the academic class patterns for students. I have read two papers "Curricular Flows: Trajectories, Turning Points, and
Assignment Criteria in High School Math Careers (Daniel A. McFarland, 2006)" and "Vacancy chains (Chase, 1991)". Network matrices will help us understand temporal aspects of the academic patterns for students.   [Ilona: talk to Becky, she did a great summary of learning/reading goals. What are the things that you have learned? How exactly are you going to use them in the project? Why do you think matrices are better than all other models you have used?]
