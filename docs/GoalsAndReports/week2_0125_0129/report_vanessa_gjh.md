With respect to goal (i) of aligning semester goals between the team and stakeholders, I was able to clearly outline how the team is planning on proceeding with the remainder of the semester (refining models, trying on new subsets, apply to DSS). 

Goal (ii) discusses the stakeholder expectations rather than the _team's_ plan for the semester. This is more so of what Frank sees the project at the end of the semster rather than how we want to proceed with the project. After asking Frank what he wants at the end of the semester, he said improving model accuracy was his primary goal, but we could also consider conducting a survey to determine if a recommender system would be helpful for undergrads. 

For goal (iii), refining SVD model, changing model parameters had minimal effect on performance. Considering the neighborhood method performs better, it may not be worthwhile to continue pursuing SVD for performance but rather for latent features.
