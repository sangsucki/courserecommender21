For goal (i) and (ii), I preprocess the dataset to the format it can be taken, and I tried apply the same set of training/test split as done in the SVD model and played with the model on different sets of data. For wide and deep model, it is essential what features are fed in as wide features, and which are assigned for DNN part. I tried different types of splits among user and item features but the accuracy did not seem to improve. The reason behind might lie in the feature splitting especially the deep part might require more metadata to obtain meaningful results. Another reason could be the train test split method, which was set as randomly pick 80% of the courses students take (the common split way for wide and deep model) instead of splitting students into train test sets from the SVD model (what we implemented). It makes sense in our implementation that not only students themselves are splitted into train test sets but the timeframe are splitted too in the context of predicting courses in the recommendation system.

This week our team consulted with Professor Craig Rawlings from social science department, who has provided valuable insights in terms of visualization and how to properly show the trend of students' course taking behaviors. Therefore I have spent time reading his book on Integrated Network Science. One promising network visualization is called alluvial plot which is able to show both the dominating and small fraction of trends across different timeframes and therefore can be combined into a trend format serving as reference for future students. This would be one of the major deliverables of the project and I am also studying on it too along with my teammates. 

In terms of goal settings, the previous set of goals still seem to ambitious and will be adjusted this week with a transition of focus on the clear deliverable of alluvial plot for course taking behavior and integration of grades.
