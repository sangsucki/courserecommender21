My first goal was to connect GitLab with DSS, however I was running into issues on DSS with the keys and the key needed to be changed from RSA to a developer key. I am still working on this with Darien, as he has much more experience working with DSS. As for the issue of data privacy, raw data will continue to be kept locally, as advised by Frank. Connecting GitLab to DSS will enable us to feed in data relevant to our models.

Ilona: we can help with that if you confirm in an email that Franks approves this connection

My second goal was to look into (model) ensembling. An example is combining predictions from SVD and neighborhood method to produce better predictions. After discussing with the team, we are not sure if ensembling would be a good idea. It would be computationally expensive and determining the "final prediction" would be difficult (i.e. if SVD predicts 10 classes and neighborhood predicts 10, what final 10 would be recommended). We are still discussing this method and trying to determine the pros and cons of ensembling, especially given the time left.

My last goal was to implement network visualizations from a social network analysis class I am taking. This would help track the academic pathway (what classes lead to other classes later on, how students transition from certain classes to other classes, etc.) which was our second main goal in addition to improving model accuracy. I started working on a dynamic network visualization (`03_intermediate/alluvial/network_viz.Rmd` and `03_intermediate/alluvial/alluvial_data.ipynb`) by reformatting the data and loading it into R, which is most commonly used for network visualizations. However, after a team meeting with the professor, he has recommended alluvial plots instead of a dynamic network visualization. This will continue to be a goal for the following week (see goals for week 5).

[Ilona: all of the goals you have set were reconsidered and not completed. I am not taking any points off but I would like to call your attention to this fact. What do you need to change in the future to be more productive? One suggestion is combining goals that focus on the exploration of new alternatives with the goals that defiantly move the project forward.]
