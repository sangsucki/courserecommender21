I successfully created the mobility matrix from the first year to the second year. 

(i) (this week) I will do data preprocessing for the third year and the fourth year this week

(ii) (this week) I will create the mobility matrix from the second year to the third year and from the third year to the fourth year 
(iii) (overarching goal) I will connect the three different mobility matrix (first year to second year, second year to third year, fourth year) in one plot and hopefully we are able to see the academic trajectories for Econ subset.

(iv) (~ 2/20 ) I will investigate how grade is embedded in the mobility matrix. I have a meeting with Professor Craig to get advice regarding this issue. I will study on ‘turning point’ when students change their major decision depending on their grade.
[Ilona: sounds great! Goals have specific tangible results! When you investigate 'turning point', keep in mind that the change of major might or might not depend on students' grade]
