(i) I preprocessed data (Econ subset from 2005 to 2008) throughout all years and reformatted to fit for the network visualization. I provided the preprocessed data for our team to do our next step, which is for the network visualization. 

ii) I successfully created the mobility matrix throughout all years. I tried all classes from one semester to the other and I figured that this was difficult to understand with one plot. So, I condensed the matrix by setting different thresholds for the percentage of classes that people have taken. Still, this included a lot of information and I drew the plot for top 10 classes, which capture how classes are transitioning to the next year classes.

iii) Our team had a meeting with Professor Craig from social science department to get advice regarding network visualization. Specifically, we learned how we show the trend of studentsâ€™ course trajectories. He suggested alluvial plots and this will be my next goal for the next week.

all works are saved in `mobility matrix` folder.

Ilona: good!
