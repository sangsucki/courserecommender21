[Ilona: there need to be a summary of what you have completed based on your previous goals, or notion that meeting has altered your previous goals]

After speaking John Haws and reading the two papers suggested by Craig Rawlings, my goal this week as follows:
(i) I will do data-processing to fit our network matrix, which needs to modify based on our current data format. [Ilona: why this goal is important, how does it speak to overall project goals, how long it will take?] 
(ii) I will create a matrix that connects courses with courses by each semester (hopefuly) suggested by the papers.[[Ilona: I like it has a clear deliverable, what is your estimate of how long it is going to take?]
(iii) I will study how to visualize the matrix in an effective way using R or python. [Ilona: every learning goal needs to have a clear plan; how long you are going to learn? how do you know that you have mastered the skill or gain the knowledge you wanted.]

Overall, I will keep track of academic paths for students using netwrok methods. [Ilona: this is unclear, you probably meant to say this goal first as an overarching goal, and your i-iii goals are steps to achieve it?]
