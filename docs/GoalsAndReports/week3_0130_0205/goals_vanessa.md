[Ilona: report summarizing your achievement from the previous week with specifics deliverables is missing]
After speaking with John Haws, we identified a few areas to explore then split them amongst the team members. My main goal this week is to look into the latent features of SVD and determine if there are any useful features (have a strong impact on predicting courses). I aim to identify if there are certain earlier courses that determine success (grades) in later courses. I expect that it will be difficult to identify specific courses given the search space and large number of courses. [Ilona: if you think the goal is difficult, it is helpful to split it into steps with specific achievable results. It might not work for the whole dataset, but you might be able to do so in a subset or a major. Also, it is good to indicate how will you know that you are succeeding or failing in this goal (intermediate milestones)] This will take about 3 days. 

John also suggested using a very simple logistic regression to predict the probability that a student takes a class. I aim to work on this in the later half of the week and continue to work on it the following week if initial accuracy metrics seem promising. Notably, we would not be able to compare performance between this model and our current models because they model different things. Thus, there is no threshold or goal accuracy at the moment. [Ilona: What is the goal of logistic regression? identify strong predictors?]
