# Goal 1: Alluvial Plots
My first goal was to implement the __alluvial plots__ that track the flow of students from one semester to another. I was successful in doing this for the econ subset: see directory titled `03_intermediate/alluvial`. All plots are in the folder titled `plots`, the data wrangling code is in `alluvial_data.ipynb`, and the code for creating plots is in `network_viz.Rmd`. This works towards the big picture goal of tracking academic pathway because it can highlight what classes students commonly take after taking a certain class. For example, if a student takes economic principles, what class(es) are they likely to take next. I was really happy about accomplishing this goal because it is a clear and understandable visualization to track the progression of students from class to class. I still have a lot of improvements planned to improve these plots (see goals), such as streamlining with DSS and making the plots interactive. 

# Goal 2: Presentation
My second goal was to work on our presentation to the class on Friday. We completed this as a team through meetings with one another in addition to a meeting with Ilona for feedback, which was really helpful in adding animations and creating a more seamless and understandable presentation. Overall, the team as a whole worked well together, and our final presentation went decently well. We aim to meet for further feedback and clarification with a member of the Capstone team. The final presentation can be found in `docs/presentations/spring_class_presentation.pptx`.

# Additional Accomplishment: Tableau Dashboards
In addition to accomplishing both of the previously stated goals, in putting together the presentation and thinking about the flow and idea of storytelling, I also created 2 new Tableau dashboards to facilitate class selection. The main idea for these dashboards is to enable students to input multiple classes (rather than just 1 like in the alluvial plots), and see what majors are popular, what classes to take, and when to take those classes. Both dashboards are in the `02_eda/EDA_2013_2020.twb` Tableau file. This works towards the main goal of tracking a student's academic pathway.

# Summary
Overall, within the last week, I think the team as a whole is making great progress in our two main goals of 1) tracking __academic pathway__ and 2) developing a __course recommendation engine__. We have created new visualizations for tracking academic pathway as well as implemented new pre and post processing techniques that have improved our model performance by an average of about 28%. 


[Ilona: great! A very clear explanation, I am happy to see GitLab committs]
