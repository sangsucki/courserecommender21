I) Prepare a storyline to deliver our presentation for the capstone class
 - 1) improved prediction rate: apply cosine similarity to the 2013-2019 dataset. 
    2) academic trajectories: Network visualization and alluvial plot(if it is done) 

ii) Modify plots for the network visualization to be able to deliver our findings: the size of node, edge, color and location configuration. 
[Ilona: good! are you visualizing academic trajectories on an alluvial plot? Just talk to Ryan about it, he endorses this direction for your team. Another question: are you improving the prediction rate of the matrix model? Did you establish what will be the final product of your work by the end of March?]

iii) Build a dashboard using tableau to show what major students would end up choosing given different courses. (Ex: given ‘intro to economics’, how percentage of people ended up selecting their major as ‘economics’? ) (overarching goals) I could include grade and expect what percentage of majors were chosen depending on their grade.

[Ilona: is it a new goal to predict "choosing a major"? What is the justification for exploring the association between major and grade? how it contributes to the overall recommendation system? By now you have consulted and got ideas from multiple experts, you (as a team) need to set up your story (in agreement with your client needs). Please revisit the main goal of the project and consolidate your efforts as a team on the final deliverable.]
