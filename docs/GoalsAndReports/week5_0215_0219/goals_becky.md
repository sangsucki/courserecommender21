In terms of goal settings, the previous set of goals still seem to ambitious and this will be adjusted this week with a transition of focus on the clear deliverable of alluvial plot for course taking behavior and integration of grades.

This week I plan to achieve the following:
(i) Decide on the modeling part. There are some other models that I want to try including (1)combining the lightfm model with the wide and deep component, (2) sequential recommender model. However, I understand the timeline is tight and there might not be that much time for further exploration given the previous results. This week I will first have a summary of our current model, which one works comparatively better and settle on that choice. The remaining time will be first put to goal (ii) and will do some further exploration if there is any time left.

[Ilona: I strongly recommend limiting explorations. I encourage consider what you already know and establish with the team and the client what would be the final product of your work with them]

(ii) Help on the alluvial plot and see if grade information can be potentially added. This process might be slower for me as I am not currently enrolled in the network analysis class and need to learn the basics from the book first. Sangsoek and Vanassa are skilled in this area, and I want to be able to learn and contribute in this deliverable too. 

[Ilona: if you are planning to use grades, make sure that this contributes to the final product that you are planning with the team and the client]
